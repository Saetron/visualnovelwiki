## What’s FSR?

**AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution** (FSR) is a built-in upscaling software that comes with every Steam Deck.\
And so, we’re going to use this upscaling for Visual Novels to improve image quality & blurry fonts.

> [!info] Info
> While some advise against some upscaling software, this isn’t true for the Steam Deck. 
> We’re working with a very small screen (1280x800), so upscaling isn’t blown out of proportion here.
> Therefore, we recommend its usage because it almost always looks better than standard definition.

## How to Upscale VNs with FSR

1. To start, press the **… button** quick menu and head over to the **Performance** tab
2. You’ll want to set **Performance Overlay Level** to **5**, and turn on **Use per-game** profile

You’ll see a FSR indicator at **3**. This indicates if FSR is on or off.

3. Head down and set **Scaling Filter** to **FSR**, and **FSR Sharpness** to **5**.

FSR will still show OFF, and that’s normal.\
FSR only turns **on when your resolution is lower than the native resolution** of the Steam Deck, which is 1280x800.\
And so, you will need to **lower the in-game resolution** until it shows FSR ON.\
Here, FSR turns on starting at 800x600 resolution.

## Forcing a Game Resolution

If your VN doesn’t offer an in-game resolution changer-- you can force a resolution to be used in Steam Game Mode.\
To do so, please follow the below steps.

1. Press the **… button** on the VN you’d like to change its resolution.
2. Select Properties, then scroll down. Change the **Game Resolution** to something lower than **1280x800**; the Steam Deck’s native resolution.

You may need to fiddle around with the resolution until the Steam Deck automatically upscales the image.
