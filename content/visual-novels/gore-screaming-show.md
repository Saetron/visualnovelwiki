## Installation

### Linux

#### Lutris

> [!info] Information
> Tested with [Lutris-GE-Proton 7-32](/visualnovelwiki/linux/adding-wine-versions).

Add locally installed game with these settings:

* In "Game info", select "Wine" for "Runner"
* In "Game options", select "lavfilters" prefix directory for "Wine prefix" and `game.exe` for "Executable"
* In "Runner options", set one "DLL override" to fix font issues: `ddraw=n,b`
* In "System options", set up Japanese locales with this environment variable: `LC_ALL=ja_JP.utf8`

> [!info] Information
> Make sure DLL Overrides are saved and play the game in windowed mode as fullscreen can be broken.

#### Steam

In Steam, right click "Gore Screaming Show", select "Properties", visit the "Launch Options" tab and copy paste the following command:

```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw.dll=n,b" LANG="ja_JP.utf8" %command%
```

### Steam Deck

Same as Linux.
