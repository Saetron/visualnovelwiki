## Installation

### Windows

First, we’ll need to get the [Love2D engine](https://www.love2d.org/). Make sure you have the right 64bit/32bit version depending on your system.
Thenn, install Love2D engine Installer (non-zip), open the n7e.love game file and enjoy!

> [!info] Info
> If you chose the zip installer, you’ll have to drag and drop n7e.love into the love file inside of the zip to run-- in other words, this is the same as: `love n7e.love in the terminal`

### GNU/Linux

Download the [Love2D engine AppImage](https://www.love2d.org/) release. This will allow you to play the game natively. Run "n7e.love" using the Love2D AppImage in the terminal `<path-to-love2d> <path-to-n7e>`.
To run using Steam, add the AppImage as a non-Steam game. Enter the Properties, then add `<path-to-n7e>` after the AppImage path. Finally, run the game an enjoy!

### Steam Deck

Same as Linux, use "Desktop Mode" to add and use "Mouse Only" control template in game mode.

## Save Data

### Windows

Overwrite the folder contents in `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\Never7Eternal`.

### Linux/Steam Deck

Overwrite the folder contents in `~/.local/share/love/Never7Eternal`.
