## Installation

### Windows

Run the [patch installer](https://steamcommunity.com/app/802880/discussions/0/3418811381786665974/) and it will locate your game folder automatically.

### Linux

1. Download [innoextract](https://constexpr.org/innoextract/). You can also install it via your system package manager.
2. Go to your "Downloads" folder and extract innoextract into its own folder.
3. Right click anywhere in the folder that you extracted innoextract into and select "Open in Terminal".
4. Drag and drop the `MuvLuv_DirectorsCut.exe` file in the "innoextract" folder.
5. Input this command and hit "Enter". This will use innoextract to extract the executable into its raw patch files.

   ```
   ./innoextract MuvLuv_DirectorsCut.exe
   ```

   You should now see a new folder called "app", which will contain a file called `muvluv16.rio.drcruo1` among other files.

6. Rename `muvluv16.rio.drcruo1` to `muvluv16.rio.ruo1`
7. Drag and drop all of the files inside of the "app" folder into the Steam game install folder and overwrite all elements. To find the Steam game folder, open Steam, right click "Muv Luv", click "Properties", click "Local Files", then "Browse". This opens up the game folder.
