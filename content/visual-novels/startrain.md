## Installation

### GNU/Linux

#### Lutris

Mount the game with "cdemu" and follow the installer or manually extract the content from "Files" into a folder on your disk (should not be needed if you have the digital version)
Add a locally installed game in Lutris withe following settings:

* In "Game info", select "Wine" for "Runner"
* In "Game options", select the wmp10quartz prefix directory for "Wine prefix" and `StarTRain.exe` for "Executable"
* In "Runner options", disable "DXVK" and select "Lutris 7.2" for "Wine version"
* In "System options", set up Japanese locales, fonts and add the following environment variable and its value: `LC_ALL=ja_JP.utf8`

> [!warning] Warning
> It won’t properly fullscreen under Wine and Proton on Linux. You can use gamescope to get around it.

### Steam Deck

Same as Linux, you will need to transfer the game files from another PC. Run it in gaming mode to get proper fullscreen working and enable FSR for sharper font.
