## Installation

### Windows

Follow Linux guide from step 5.

### Linux

1. Get Fate/stay night [Réalta Nua].
2. Get the [Lutris auto-installer](https://lutris.net/games/fatestay-night/)
3. You’ll be prompted for your Fate files.
4. It’ll take a while to extract and load up the files. Wait until you get a `setup.exe` pop-up.
5. When it comes to installing patches, leave everything unticked. They’ll fail downloading anyways. We’re going to install these manually later.
6. Find the `Fate / stay night[Realta Nua] Ultimate Edition` game folder inside of the `drive_c` directory. Drag and drop the [patches you downloaded](https://www.mediafire.com/file/047tv8akannrti3/patch.zip/file) (password is "ObviouslyFate") inside of the game folder and overwrite.

### Steam Deck

Same as Linux, but set these settings in-game:

* In "Display", enable "Window mode"
* In "Display", set "Window Size" to "0.80x"
* In "Display", set "Aspect Ratio" to "Wide"

## Save Data

### Linux / Steam Deck

Overwrite the folder contents in `<wineprefixfolder>/drive_c/users/<username>/Documents/faterealtanua_savedata`
