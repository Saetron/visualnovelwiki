1. Create folder structure.

   Nagivate to your wmp10quartz prefix at the following directory `<prefixname>/drive_c/Program Files/`
   Create a folder called GIGA
   Transfer both games ALREADY UPDATED from a Windows installation into that folder with the following name pattern: "BALDRHEART", "BALDRHEARTEXE"
   Copy AlphaROMdiE.exe into both game folders

2. Add a locally installed game with the following settings

   * In "Game info", input "BALDR HEART" for "Name" abd select "Wine" for "Runner"
   * In "Game options", select the wmp10quartz prefix directory for "Wine prefix", "AlphaROMdiE.exe" for "Executable", input "BALDR HEART.exe" with the quotes for "Arguments" and select 32bit for "Wine architecture"
   * In "Runner options", select "Lutris 7.2" for "Wine version", enable "VKD3D", disable "dgvoodoo2" and "DXVK"
   * In "System options", set up Japanese locales, add and environment variables and its value: `LC_ALL=ja_JP.utf8`

   Select "BALDR HEART", click the Wine bottle on the bottom and click "Wine registry".
   Import the registry file we extracted before and click on "Registry" and "Import Registry File".
   Registry keys should have been added to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/GIGA/BALDRHEART`

4. Check if both games link is successful

   Run BALDR HEART.
   A warning about auto update may appear. Click "Yes" or "No", it does not matter as the game has been already been updated to the latest version.
   If everything went correctly, a message should appear in-game.
