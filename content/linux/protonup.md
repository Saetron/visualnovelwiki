[ProtonUp-Qt](https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt) is a tool based on [protonup](https://github.com/AUNaseef/protonup) to install [GE-Proton](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) and [Wine-GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom) versions. [Protonup-rs](https://github.com/auyer/Protonup-rs) is another similar program but use a text-based user interface instead of a GUI.

In the Steam Deck it can be installed from the Discover Store.
