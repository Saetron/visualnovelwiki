[rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs](https://github.com/bakustarver/rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs) is a bash script mainly developed to run RPG Maker games (XP, VX, VX Ace, MV, MZ) natively. It also supports TyranoBuilder, Godot, Construct 2/3 and NScripter games.

Most RPG Maker games should work with Wine but some of them have case-sensitive issues. It can also start games from the right-click menu inside your file manager and be added to Steam as a compatibility tool.

## Installation

> [!warning] Warning
> Do not execute random Bash scripts without checking them first.

Follow the instructions from the [Github page](https://github.com/bakustarver/rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs).
