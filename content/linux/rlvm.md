[rlvm](https://github.com/eglaysher/rlvm) is an open-source reimplementation of the VisualArt's KK's RealLive interpreter for GNU/Linux and macOS.

## Usage

Start the executable using an application launcher or from a terminal emulator with `rlvm /path/to/game/`. You also need to have a "msgothic.ttc" font file in the game or home directory. Otherwise, you'd have to specify a Japanese font file with `rlvm /path/to/game/ --font font.ttc`.
